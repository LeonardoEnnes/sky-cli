# sky-cli
Sky CLI is a powerful and versatile command-line interface designed for developers who need to streamline their workflow. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for managing APIs, handling file operations, manipulating data, and using templates to simplify repetitive tasks. Whether youâ€™re automating file operations, making API requests, or processing data, sky-cli has you covered!

### ðŸš€ Features
1. #### File Management
    - **File and Folder Listing:** Interactively list files and directories with filters for file type, size, or creation date.

    - **File Operations:** Move, copy, rename, and delete files or directories. An interactive mode confirms potentially destructive actions (like deletions).

    - **Advanced Search:** Search inside files using regular expressions or by metadata such as creation or modification date.
    
    - **File Comparison:** Compare the contents of two files, useful for developers needing to track changes between file versions.

2. #### API Interaction
    - **HTTP Requests:** Perform HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with support for custom headers, authentication, and JSON payloads.

    - **API Monitoring:** Periodically ping API endpoints to track status, response times, and potential errors.

    - **API Logs:** Store and view logs of previous API requests for debugging and analysis.
3. #### Data Manipulation
    - **Format Conversion:** Convert between data formats like JSON, XML, and CSV with options for filtering and transforming data.
    - **Filtering and Sorting:** Filter and sort JSON or CSV data directly from the CLI.
    - **Local Data Search:** Perform advanced searches within large data files (JSON, CSV) using keys, values, or regular expressions.
4. #### Template Creation
    - **Project Structure Generation:** Quickly generate project structures for popular frameworks or libraries with initial files (e.g., index.js, package.json).
    - **Custom Templates:** Create and store personalized templates to speed up project generation.
    - **Configurable Templates:** Customize templates during creation, such as including/excluding dependencies or configuring linters and test environments.

## How to use the API Interaction

- Requests: 
    ```
    node index.js request --url=YOUR-API --method=GET
    ```

- Monitoring
    ```
    node index.js monitor --url=YOUR-API --interval=10000
    ```

- Logs
    ```
    node index.js logs
    ```

## How to use the File Management

- Read Files in any directory: 

    ```
    node index.js read-file --file=logs/file.extension
    ```

- Write files in any directory:

    ```
    node index.js write-file --file=logs/file.txt --content="hello world"
    ```

- Delete files in any directory:

    ```
    node index.js delete-file --file=logs/file.txt
    ```
