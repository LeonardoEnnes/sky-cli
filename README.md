### ðŸš€ Features
1. #### File Management
    - **File and Folder Listing:** Interactively list files and directories with filters for file type, size, or creation date.

    - **File Operations:** Move, copy, rename, and delete files or directories. An interactive mode confirms potentially destructive actions (like deletions).

    - **Advanced Search:** Search inside files using regular expressions or by metadata such as creation or modification date.
    
    - **File Comparison:** Compare the contents of two files, useful for developers needing to track changes between file versions.

2. #### API Interaction
    - **HTTP Requests:** Perform HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with support for custom headers, authentication, and JSON payloads.

    - **API Monitoring:** Periodically ping API endpoints to track status, response times, and potential errors.

    - **API Logs:** Store and view logs of previous API requests for debugging and analysis.

3. #### Data Manipulation
    - **Format Conversion:** Convert between data formats like JSON, XML, and CSV.

4. #### Template Creation
    - **Project Structure Generation:** Quickly generate project structures for popular frameworks or libraries with initial files (e.g., index.js, package.json).
    - **Custom Templates:** Create and store personalized templates to speed up project generation.
    - **Configurable Templates:** Customize templates during creation, such as including/excluding dependencies or configuring linters and test environments.
